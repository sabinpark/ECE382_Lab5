===========

### Objective
Use knowledge of interrupts and the Timer_A subsytem to reverse engineer a remote control.

#### The Basic Idea
* Lab day 1: learn the timing and bit patterns for your remote control
* Lab day 2: demonstrate your code can receive and decode button presses from the remote control
* Lab day 3: implement etch-a-sketch or pong
